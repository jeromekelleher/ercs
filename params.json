{"body":"==============================================\r\nExtinction/recolonisation coalescent simulator\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\nSimulates the coalescent for populations evolving in a spatial \r\ncontinuum under the extinction/recolonisation model. The simulations \r\nsupport:\r\n        \r\n- A sample of ``n`` individuals with ``m`` loci at arbitrary locations on a \r\n  torus of diameter ``L``.\r\n- Recombination occurs between locus ``j`` and ``j + 1`` at an event \r\n  with probability ``rho[j]``.\r\n- An arbitrary number of classes of event occuring at fixed\r\n  rates. \r\n\r\nFull documentation available at [documentation](docs/index.html)","note":"Don't delete this file!
