The simulations \r\nsupport:\r\n        \r\n- A sample of ``n`` individuals with ``m`` loci at arbitrary locations on a \r\n  torus of diameter ``L``.\r\n- Recombination occurs between locus ``j`` and ``j + 1`` at an event \r\n  with probability ``rho[j]``.\r\n- An arbitrary number of classes of event occuring at fixed\r\n  rates. \r\n\r\nErcs supports both Python 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nHere's a quick example for the impatient::\r\n\r\n        import ercs\r\n        sim = ercs.Simulator(10)\r\n        sim.sample =  [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]\r\n        sim.event_classes = [ercs.DiscEventClass(rate=1.0, u=0.5, r=1)]\r\n        pi, tau = sim.simulate(1)\r\n\r\nFull documentation for ``ercs`` is available at `<http://www.homepages.ed.ac.uk/jkellehe/ercs/doc>`_.","name":"Ercs"}
