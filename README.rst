==============================================
Extinction/recolonisation coalescent simulator
==============================================

Simulates the coalescent for populations evolving in a spatial 
continuum under the extinction/recolonisation model. The simulations 
support:
        
- A sample of ``n`` individuals with ``m`` loci at arbitrary locations on a 
  torus of diameter ``L``.
- Recombination between locus ``j`` and ``j + 1`` at an event 
  with probability ``rho[j]``.
- An arbitrary number of classes of event occuring at fixed
  rates. 

Ercs supports both Python 2 and 3.

Here's a quick example for the impatient::

        import ercs
        sim = ercs.Simulator(10)
        sim.sample =  [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)]
        sim.event_classes = [ercs.DiscEventClass(rate=1.0, u=0.5, r=1)]
        pi, tau = sim.simulate(1)

Full documentation for ``ercs`` is available at `http://jeromekelleher.github.com/ercs/`_.

------------
Installation
------------

Ercs depends on the `GNU Scientific Library <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>`_,
which must be installed before the ``ercs`` module can be built.
Fortunately, this is straightforward on most platforms. For example, 
on Debian or Ubuntu use::

        $ sudo apt-get install gsl0-dev

or on Fedora::

        $ sudo yum install gsl-devel

GSL is available on most packaging systems; if it is not available on your
platform, it can be installed from source.

Once GSL has been installed we can build the ``ercs`` module using the 
standard Python `methods <http://docs.python.org/install/index.html>`_. For 
example, using pip we have ::
        
        $ sudo pip install ercs

Or, we can manually download the package, unpack it and then run::
        
        $ python setup.py build
        $ sudo python setup.py install

Most of the time this will compile and install the module without difficulty.

******************
Potential problems
******************

On platforms that GSL is not available as part of the native packaging 
system (or we had to install GSL locally because of non-root access)
there can be issues with finding the correct headers and libraries
when compiling ``ercs``. For example, on FreeBSD we get something 
like this::

        $ python setup.py build
        ... [Messages cut for brevity] ...
        In file included from _ercsmodule.c:27:
        lib/ercs.h:26:25: error: gsl/gsl_rng.h: No such file or directory
        In file included from _ercsmodule.c:27:
        lib/ercs.h:73: error: expected declaration specifiers or '...' before 'gsl_rng'
        lib/ercs.h:94: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'gsl_rng'
        _ercsmodule.c: In function 'pyercs_simulate':
        _ercsmodule.c:351: error: 'ercs_t' has no member named 'pi'
        _ercsmodule.c:356: error: 'ercs_t' has no member named 'tau'
        error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1

This can be remedied by using the ``gsl-config`` program to set the 
the ``LDFLAGS`` and ``CFLAGS`` environment variables to 
their correct values::
        
         $ CFLAGS=`gsl-config --cflags` LDFLAGS=`gsl-config --libs` python setup.py build

*****
Tests
*****

Ercs provides some test cases to ensure that the installation has gone smoothly.
It is a good idea to run these immediately after installation::

        $ python tests.py

It is also possible to run some tests on the low-level C library.
To do this, ``cd`` to the ``lib`` directory and run::

        $ make check 

This will build the C library test cases and run them. If compilation fails, it 
may be necessary set ``LDFLAGS`` and ``CFLAGS`` as before:: 

        $ make CFLAGS="`gsl-config --cflags`" LDFLAGS="`gsl-config --libs`" check
